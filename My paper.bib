abstract = {Random distributed feedback (RDFB) cascaded Raman fiber lasers (CRFLs) are simple, wavelength agile, and enable high-power fiber lasers outside emission bandwidths of rare-earth doped fiber lasers. However, the spectral purity, defined as the percentage of total output power in the desired Stokes wavelength band, and relative intensity noise (RIN) of these systems are limited due to the intensity noise of the pump source used for Raman conversion. RIN gets amplified and transferred to Raman Stokes orders which causes incomplete Raman conversion and hence limits the spectral purity. Here, we demonstrate a low-intensity noise (\&lt;--100 dBc/Hz from 9 kHz to 10â€…GHz) CRFL with a record spectral purity of $\sim$99\%, tunable over six Stokes orders, using a very low-intensity noise, narrow linewidth Yb-fiber amplifier as a pump source.},

abstract = {Cascaded Raman Fiber Lasers (CRFLs) are wavelength versatile sources that can provide power at any wavelength in the Near-Infrared (NIR) region. Conventional CRFLs with broadband feedback are widely wavelength tunable but have broad line widths. A feedback mechanism must be used to reduce the broadening of the linewidth without compromising the wavelength tunability. Here, we propose to use a dual feedback mechanism that combines broadband feedback at all wavelengths, using a flat cleave, with filtered feedback at a desired wavelength due to a grating filter. This allows substantial linewidth reduction of CRFLs up to the 6th Raman shifts, from 1100 nm to 1500 nm, and can be extended further. Significantly reduced linewidth with multi-watt in-band output power is achieved with fine wavelength tuning within each Raman Stokes band using a fixed wavelength pump. As an application of linewidth narrowed output, we performed frequency doubling of CRFL output to generate over 100 mW of wavelength tunable yellow-green and yellow output with enhanced efficiency.},
