abstract: Cascaded Raman Fiber Lasers (CRFLs) are wavelength versatile sources that
  can provide power at any wavelength in the Near-Infrared (NIR) region. Conventional
  CRFLs with broadband feedback are widely wavelength tunable but have broad line
  widths. A feedback mechanism must be used to reduce the broadening of the linewidth
  without compromising the wavelength tunability. Here, we propose to use a dual feedback
  mechanism that combines broadband feedback at all wavelengths, using a flat cleave,
  with filtered feedback at a desired wavelength due to a grating filter. This allows
  substantial linewidth reduction of CRFLs up to the 6th Raman shifts, from 1100 nm
  to 1500 nm, and can be extended further. Significantly reduced linewidth with multi-watt
  in-band output power is achieved with fine wavelength tuning within each Raman Stokes
  band using a fixed wavelength pump. As an application of linewidth narrowed output,
  we performed frequency doubling of CRFL output to generate over 100 mW of wavelength
  tunable yellow-green and yellow output with enhanced efficiency.
