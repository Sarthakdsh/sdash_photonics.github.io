abstract: Random distributed feedback (RDFB) cascaded Raman fiber lasers (CRFLs) are
  simple, wavelength agile, and enable high-power fiber lasers outside emission bandwidths
  of rare-earth doped fiber lasers. However, the spectral purity, defined as the percentage
  of total output power in the desired Stokes wavelength band, and relative intensity
  noise (RIN) of these systems are limited due to the intensity noise of the pump
  source used for Raman conversion. RIN gets amplified and transferred to Raman Stokes
  orders which causes incomplete Raman conversion and hence limits the spectral purity.
  Here, we demonstrate a low-intensity noise (&lt;--100 dBc/Hz from 9 kHz to 10 GHz)
  CRFL with a record spectral purity of $∼$99%, tunable over six Stokes orders, using
  a very low-intensity noise, narrow linewidth Yb-fiber amplifier as a pump source.
